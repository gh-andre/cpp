# Test C++ Build Actions

This is a test project that builds a C++ one-liner on Debian and
on Windows via GitHub actions.

Rename the workflow file to reflect the new version, so the build
number is restarted. This must be done first, so previous builds
are not affected in Action. Version in the workflow file may be
updated at the same time and version in test.cpp may be updated
later.
