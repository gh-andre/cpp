#
# Workflow name won't accept context expressions, such as ${{ github.run_number }}.
#
# Moreover, Actions UI confuses workflow names in different branches and while the
# name will be evaluated properly during the run (e.g. if ${{ github.workflow }}
# is used), the name of the running workflow will replace *all* run names in
# Actions UI, even for different branches, where workflow name is different. This
# makes it impossible to distinguish multiple runs without clicking on them, which
# would show the proper run name.

  # These version variables are half-measures for tracking build numbers and
  # won't work as well as Azure pipeline names and counters. If this workflow
  # file is reused between branches, build numbers will not be sequential and
  # workflow runs will be messed up in Actions UI (see `name`).
  #
  # Seems that the only way to track  build numbers per branch in GitHub is
  # to have different workflow files, which is a lot of duplication.
